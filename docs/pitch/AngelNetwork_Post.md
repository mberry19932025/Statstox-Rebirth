StatStox is a fantasy sports platform where contests, player performance markets, and social play live in one hub. We build fair-play mechanics so fans can engage after lineup lock without late-edge advantages.

Highlights:
- Problem: DFS is fragmented and static; trust drops when late info creates unfair edges.
- Solution: real-time signals, projection locks, and payout caps; player markets without real-stock risk.
- Stage: playable demo, pre-beta, iterating on data feeds and compliance readiness.
- Model: DFS rake, market spreads/transaction fees, VIP subscriptions, sponsorships.
- Founder: built the product; lived experience focused on fair play and accessibility.

Ask: Raising $1.5M seed for 18% equity (post-money $8.3M) to fund product, data/infra, compliance, and growth. Target runway is 18 months to beta launch and compliance-ready rollout.
