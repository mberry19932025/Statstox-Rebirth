# StatStox One-Pager

## Vision
StatStox turns player performance into a live sports market and DFS experience, built for fairness, engagement, and community.

## Founder Story
Micheal Berry has cerebral palsy and built StatStox to make sports competition more accessible, social, and fair.

## Problem
Fantasy sports products are siloed. Fans want a single platform that blends contests, pick'em, real-time signals, and social engagement without unfair edges.

## Solution
StatStox combines:
- DFS contests (Draft Arena, Roster Run, FlexPix)
- Player market trading (Market Arena, Momentum Run)
- Live social feeds (Community Feed, Sports Feed)

## Differentiation
- Projection locks to protect fairness
- Payout caps and entry limits to prevent exploitation
- StatCoin credits for rewards (off-chain, demo-safe)

## Business Model
- DFS rake on contests
- Market spreads and trading fees
- VIP subscriptions and premium tools
- Promos and creator partnerships

## Compliance + Security
- Age verification and geofencing ready
- Responsible gaming limits
- Rate limits, audit logs, encryption, and fraud monitoring

## Traction (Demo Stage)
- Full investor demo live
- Real-time feed visuals and pick logic
- Clear backend and compliance roadmap

## Roadmap
- Backend v1 (auth, wallets, DFS, market)
- Data provider integration
- Compliance rollout by region
- Creator room launch

## Team
Founder: Micheal Berry  
Mission-driven builder and lifelong sports fan

## Why Partner
- Authentic founder story and loyal sports community
- Unique product blend: DFS + market mechanics + social
- Clear compliance roadmap and investor-ready demo

## Ask
