## Slide 2: Problem
- DFS is fragmented: contests here, projections there, social elsewhere
- Engagement drops after lineup lock; fans want real-time action
- Pricing is static and opaque; little market signal
- Trust issues: late info edges and unclear fairness

## Slide 3: Solution
- One hub for contests, player performance markets, and community
- Real-time signals + projection locks + payout caps to reduce late-edge advantages
- StatCoin is in-app rewards (not crypto)

## Slide 4: Product (Current State)
- Draft Arena/Lobby, Market Arena/Feed, Momentum Run, FlexPix
- Community Feed, Locker Room, Sports Feed
- Playable demo built; pre-beta and iterating on data feeds

## Slide 5: Market & Timing
- Large, growing U.S. fantasy sports market with strong adjacent interest in sports betting
- Tens of millions of U.S. fantasy players; DFS is the high-engagement, paid subset
- Initial wedge: DFS players and sports creators in legal DFS states
- Expand to team-based communities and casual fans after compliance rollout
- Market sizing and regulatory mapping underway

## Slide 6: Business Model
- DFS rake on contests
- Market spreads and transaction fees
- VIP subscriptions for tools, rooms, and perks
- Sponsorships and promotional partnerships
- Major costs: data feeds, infra, compliance, and support

## Slide 7: Differentiation
- Player performance market without real-stock risk
- Fairness controls: projection locks, payout caps, anti-late-entry
- Social-first loops: creator rooms, sharing, and leaderboards
- Compliance-first roadmap (geofencing, KYC/AML, responsible gaming)

## Slide 8: Progress / Proof
- Investor demo live; core contest, market, and social loops built
- End-to-end UI flows across Draft, Market, and Community

## Slide 9: Go-to-Market
- Partner with sports creators to host rooms and leagues
- Community-led growth in targeted geos
- Paid acquisition only after LTV/CAC signals in test markets
- Referral + social sharing loops

## Slide 10: Competition & Positioning
